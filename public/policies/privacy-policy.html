            <h2>1) Scope</h2>
            <p>
              This policy applies to information we process in connection with the Service. It does not cover third
              parties we do not control (such as your bank, email provider, or shipping carrier).
            </p>

            <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
            <p>Depending on how you interact with us, we may collect:</p>
